# JavaScript and the DOM | Project & Course
The environment that JavaScript runs in — like a browser, or a server, or even an embedded computer — has a fundamental effect on what it can do. I wanted some practice on how we can further explore the browser environment, and see how JavaScript can change a webpage right before our eyes.

The first step of making a web page interactive is grabbing ahold of elements you want the user to interact with. This is called selection. There are a number of ways to select elements on a web page. In this project I practiced selecting different elements with Javascript and changing attributes. 

**Some of the different tasks included:**

* Learning more about the DOM and how to manipulate it
* Selecting page elements by ID
* Selecting all elements of a particular type
* Selecting elements with the same class name
* Using CSS queries to select page elements
* Selecting mutiple elements
* Traversing the DOM
